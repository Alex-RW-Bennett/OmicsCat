# OmicsCat
Concatenation integration for generic multi-omics datasets.

Produces a network graph of co-expression relationships between 'molecular species' among different -omics datasets.

Notably, it is capable of handling time-course datasets. I have developed this for examination of co-regulatory relationships during circadian rhythms.

At this stage the script does not include functionality for detecion of rhythmicity, I am testing for rhythmicity using other tools and importing rhythmic species manually.

Incorporating rhytmicity detetcion may be beyond the scope of this script, we will see how things develop.
